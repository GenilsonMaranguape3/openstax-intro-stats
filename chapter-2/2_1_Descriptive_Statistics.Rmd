## Descriptive Statistics
2.1 Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs

## Try It
For the Park City basketball team, scores for the last 30 games were as follows (smallest to largest): 

32; 32; 33; 34; 38; 40; 42; 42; 43; 44; 46; 47; 47; 48; 48; 48; 49; 50; 50; 51; 52; 52; 52; 53; 54; 56; 57; 57; 60; 61 

Construct a stem plot for the data.

## Apply the stem function to compute the stem-and-leaf plot of basket ball team scores.
```{r }
scores <- c(32, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 47, 48, 48, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 52, 52, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 57, 60, 61)

stem(scores)
```
