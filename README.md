## OpenStax: Introduction to Statistics with R

This repository will detail R code solutions for the 2017 edition of [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/)'s *Introduction to Statistics*. Huge thanks to the [authors](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics#details), and to [Rick Baraniuk](http://www.ece.rice.edu/baraniuk.aspx) for having the vision to place open-source, remixable textbooks online.
